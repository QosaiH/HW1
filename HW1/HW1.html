      <h2>How Many Types Of Melon Do You Know?</h2>
      <p>
        Is it even really summer before you’ve eaten a juicy wedge of
        watermelon? Or a piece of prosciutto-wrapped cantaloupe? How about
        Tajín-dusted honeydew? We think not. While you and these three popular
        melons go way back, there are a ton more to explore. Melons have been
        around for more than 4,000 years, and there are nearly 40 types of
        melons out there to date. Personally, we’re on a mission to taste as
        many of them as we can. Here are 4 kinds to look out for, plus recipes
        to try with each one.

  <h2>Popular Types Of Melon:</h2>
  <section id="watermelon" class="hero">
    <img class="watermelonC" src="WM.jpg" alt="watermelon" />
    <div>
      <h2>Watermelon</h2>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taste: Sweet, refreshing, juicy</li>
        <li>
          Watermelon is a must at every summer soiree, and if you’ve tasted
          it before, it should be no mystery why. To pick a ripe one at the
          grocery store or farmers market, look for a watermelon that’s deep
          green in color with a cream- or yellow-colored ground spot. Pick
          it up and give the ground spot a hard tap—if it sounds deep and
          hollow, it’s ready to devour.

      <h2>Cantaloupec</h2>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taste: Sweet, tender</li>
        <li>
          Unlike watermelon, cantaloupe has a firmer, less mealy texture.
          So, we love serving it with different charcuterie meats and
          proteins because it holds its shape and isn’t as watery. They’re
          at peak deliciousness come late spring. Look for cantaloupes that
          are tan with light green lines on the outside and free of soft
          spots.

      <h2>Honeydew</h2>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taste: Light, slightly sweet, mild</li>
        <li>
          This melon, which is in season from June through October, is
          wildly underrated. It can offer light sweetness to salads, frozen
          yogurt, smoothies and even cocktails. You know a honeydew is ripe
          when the rind is a creamy yellow color and smooth or waxy to the
          touch; it should feel a bit springy on the bottom.

      <ul>
        <li>Taste: Spicy, aromatic, slightly sweet</li>
        <li>
          If you’re wondering why this melon looks closer to a squash or
          pumpkin than a watermelon, it’s because melons are actually part
          of the gourd family, along with cucumbers. A type of muskmelon
          that’s closely related to honeydew and cantaloupe, casaba is named
          after its place of origin, Kasaba, Turkey. Use them in smoothies,
          soups, curries or sorbet, or just snack on them raw.

        This scary-looking melon is unique for having horns on it. When not
        ripe, it tastes like cucumber, and when ripe, it tastes similar to a
        banana.It’s mainly grown in Newzealand and the US. The jelly-like
        flesh has seeds that are edible too. But the peel is completely
        inedible.

        in the mouth. It can be added to smoothies, fruit salads, or eaten
        raw.

      <p>
        Mainly used as a vegetable, Winter gourd is also used in stews,
        stir-fried dishes, and soups. Since it has a mild taste, it’s cooked
        with strong-flavored items like chicken to get a richer flavor. In
        countries like the Indian subcontinent, it’s known for boosting energy
        levels and improving digestion.

        The common name for this melon in Southeast Asia is Sarda. It’s a
        cross between the netted-skin melon, Krimka, and the green-flesh
        melon, Ha-Ogen. It’s also eaten as a fruit.
