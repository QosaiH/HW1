      <h2>How Many Types Of Melon Do You Know?</h2>
      <p>
        Is it even really summer before you’ve eaten a juicy wedge of watermelon? Or a piece of prosciutto-wrapped
        cantaloupe? How about Tajín-dusted honeydew? We think not. While you and these three popular melons go way back,
        there are a ton more to explore. Melons have been around for more than 4,000 years, and there are nearly 40
        types of melons out there to date. Personally, we’re on a mission to taste as many of them as we can. Here are 4
        kinds to look out for, plus recipes to try with each one.

  <h2>Popular Types Of Melon:</h2>

  <section id="watermelon" class="hero">
    <img class="watermelonC" src="WM.jpg" alt="Watermelon">
    <div>
      <h2>Watermelon</h2>
      <p>
        Taste: Sweet, refreshing, juicy
        <br> Watermelon is a must at every summer soiree, and if you’ve tasted it before, it should be no mystery why.
        To pick a ripe one at the grocery store or farmers market, look for a watermelon that’s deep green in color with
        a cream- or yellow-colored ground spot. Pick it up and give the ground spot a hard tap—if it sounds deep and
        hollow, it’s ready to devour.

  <section id="cantaloupe" class="hero">
    <img class="cantaloupec" src="Canta.jpg" alt="Cantaloupe">
    <div>
      <h2>Cantaloupe</h2>
      <p>
        Taste: Sweet, tender
        <br> Unlike watermelon, cantaloupe has a firmer, less mealy texture. So, we love serving it with different
        charcuterie meats and proteins because it holds its shape and isn’t as watery. They’re at peak deliciousness
        come late spring. Look for cantaloupes that are tan with light green lines on the outside and free of soft
        spots.

  <section id="honeydew" class="hero">
    <img class="honeydewc" src="Honeydew.jpg" alt="Honeydew">
    <div>
      <h2>Honeydew</h2>
      <p>
        Taste: Light, slightly sweet, mild
        <br> This melon, which is in season from June through October, is wildly underrated. It can offer light
        sweetness to salads, frozen yogurt, smoothies and even cocktails. You know a honeydew is ripe when the rind is a
        creamy yellow color and smooth or waxy to the touch; it should feel a bit springy on the bottom.

  <section id="casabamelon" class="hero">
    <img class="casabamelonc" src="CM.jpg" alt="Casaba melon">
    <div>
      <h2>Casaba Melon</h2>
      <p>
        Taste: Spicy, aromatic, slightly sweet
        <br> If you’re wondering why this melon looks closer to a squash or pumpkin than a watermelon, it’s because
        melons are actually part of the gourd family, along with cucumbers. A type of muskmelon that’s closely related
        to honeydew and cantaloupe, casaba is named after its place of origin, Kasaba, Turkey. Use them in smoothies,
        soups, curries or sorbet, or just snack on them raw.

      <img src="Kiwano.jpg" alt="Kiwano melon">
      <p>
        This scary-looking melon is unique for having horns on it. When not ripe, it tastes like cucumber, and when
        ripe, it tastes similar to a banana. It’s mainly grown in New Zealand and the US. The jelly-like flesh has seeds
        that are edible too. But the peel is completely inedible.

        the Cadillac of all the melons.

      <img src="Winter melon.jpg" alt="Winter melon">
      <p>
        Mainly used as a vegetable, Winter gourd is also used in stews, stir-fried dishes, and soups. Since it has a
        mild taste, it’s cooked with strong-flavored items like chicken to get a richer flavor. In countries like the
        Indian subcontinent, it’s known for boosting energy levels and improving digestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The common name for this melon in Southeast Asia is Sarda. It’s a cross between the netted-skin melon, Krimka,
        and the green-flesh melon, Ha-Ogen. It’s also eaten as a fruit.

        as well (just 34 calories in 100g).
